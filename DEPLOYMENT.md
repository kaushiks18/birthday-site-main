## ðŸš€ Deploy Your Birthday Site to GitHub Pages

### âœ… All Issues Fixed:

- Optimized for static export

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "New repository" (green button)
3. Name it something like `birthday-celebration` or any name you like
4. Make sure it's **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub
Copy and run these commands in your terminal (replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME):

```powershell
# Add your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Save the settings

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
- Check the "Actions" tab to see the deployment progress
- Once complete, your site will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME`

## âœ… What's Fixed and Configured:
